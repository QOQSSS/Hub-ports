This is a project for solving stochastic programming model optimization problems using MATLAB and Gurobi. The project provides parameter settings for the solution process, data such as carbon tax, and an introduction to the research framework.
Specifically, the project files can be divided into the following two parts:
﻿

﻿
Part One: Trade data, solution parameter settings, and parameter information
1.CarbonTax
2.LinerRouteCode
3.ScenarioSettings
4.SolverParameterSettings
5.TradeData_2022_UNcomtrade and TradeData_2023_UNcomtrade
﻿
Part Two: Analytical Framework and Research Flowchart
1.Analytical Framework
2.Research Flowchart
